## Level 1 Tasks 🎯

### Task 1: Web Development Project - Landing Page
📝 Description: A landing page is one of the best web development projects for beginners. This project demands a foundational understanding of HTML and CSS. You will learn how to add columns, divide sections, arrange items, and add headers, and footers. Most importantly, you will use your creativity to make the page look impressive. The alignments, the padding, the color palette, the boxes, and all the other elements on the page require attention. Use CSS carefully to ensure the page elements do not overlap.

### Task 3: Web Development Project - Temperature Converter Website
📝 Description: The user will input a temperature in either Fahrenheit or Celsius and press a "convert" button. The converted temperature will then be displayed with the correct unit. Your UI should include four main elements: Input field for the user to type in their temperature - don't forget to validate that the input is a number! Dropdown menu or radio button for the user to choose if they are inputting in Celsius or Fahrenheit. "Convert" button to trigger the temperature conversion. Display area for the final converted temperature and unit. For an extra challenge: You can add a third conversion option to convert from and to Kelvin as well.

## Level 2 Tasks 🚀

### Task 1: Web Development Project - Calculator
📝 Description: It takes a little skill to create a calculator with basic mathematical functionalities using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. Calculators require an interactive interface to perform basic functions such as addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication. It will need a display screen to display the user's input and give the results. The grid system in CSS is for the alignment of buttons on the calculator. The additional tools you need to build a fully functional calculator include event listeners, if-else statements, operators, loops, and so on.

### Task 2: Web Development Project - Tribute Page
📝 Description: With a basic understanding of HTML and CSS, you can easily create a page for someone you admire. Write about what you adore in the person, add images, give an appealing layout, and use paragraphs appropriately. You can also play around with different font styles and background colors.

### Task 3: Web Development Project - A basic To-Do web app
📝 Description: Develop a basic to-do app that enables a user to add daily tasks. The to-do web app must allow users to add new items to a list, and items added to a list must be visible. Also, a user can mark a task “complete” upon its successful completion, and these completed tasks must appear on a separate list, say Completed Tasks. You can also add a separate section titled Pending Tasks that will list all the tasks that require completion. In such a case, the to-do list will be a union of the Pending Tasks list and the Completed Tasks list. Irrespective of the list, a user must be able to delete or edit tasks from it. To further increase the web app’s complexity or make it more detailed, you can add the date and time when a task is added and/or completed.
