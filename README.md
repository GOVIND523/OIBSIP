# 🌟 Oasis Infobyte Internship Tasks 🚀

Welcome to my internship repository for Oasis Infobyte! This repository showcases the tasks I have completed during my internship. Each task is designed to enhance my skills and contribute to the development of real-world projects. Let's dive into the exciting challenges I've tackled! 💪

## Level 1 Tasks 🎯

### Task 1: Web Development Project - Landing Page
📝 Description: A landing page is one of the best web development projects for beginners. This project demands a foundational understanding of HTML and CSS. You will learn how to add columns, divide sections, arrange items, and add headers, and footers. Most importantly, you will use your creativity to make the page look impressive. The alignments, the padding, the color palette, the boxes, and all the other elements on the page require attention. Use CSS carefully to ensure the page elements do not overlap.

### Task 2: Web Development Project - Portfolio
📝 Description: You can create a personal portfolio with basic skills in CSS and HTML. This is yet again, one of the most common projects on web development for beginners. In a personal portfolio, you get to show a wide range of samples and skills and add your resume. You can add an image at the top where you can introduce yourself; below that, you can add contact information.

### Task 3: Web Development Project - Temperature Converter Website
📝 Description: The user will input a temperature in either Fahrenheit or Celsius and press a "convert" button. The converted temperature will then be displayed with the correct unit. Your UI should include four main elements: Input field for the user to type in their temperature - don't forget to validate that the input is a number! Dropdown menu or radio button for the user to choose if they are inputting in Celsius or Fahrenheit. "Convert" button to trigger the temperature conversion. Display area for the final converted temperature and unit. For an extra challenge: You can add a third conversion option to convert from and to Kelvin as well.
